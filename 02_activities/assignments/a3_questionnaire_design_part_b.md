# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```

The quality of my sample depends on the sampling technique I used. If I used a probability sampling method such as simple random sampling or stratified sampling, I would expect the sample to be representative of the target population. However, due to practical constraints, I had to rely on convenience sampling, which may introduce biases and reduce representativeness. Specifically, my sample may not capture all subgroups of the population proportionately, leading to an overrepresentation or underrepresentation of certain characteristics. Therefore, I do not fully expect my sample to be representative of the entire target population.

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

Based on the class content related to error, survey quality, and ethics, I have identified several changes that can improve my original survey. These changes include:

1. **Question Wording**: I noticed that some of the questions in the original survey were leading, which could bias the responses. I have reworded these questions to be more neutral to ensure that participants are not influenced towards a particular answer. For instance, instead of asking, "Do you agree that the new policy is beneficial?" I changed it to "What are your thoughts on the new policy?" This reduces acquiescence bias and improves response quality.

2. **Response Options**: Some of the response options in my original survey were not exhaustive, leading to potential measurement error. I have added an "Other" option with an open-text box for all multiple-choice questions to allow participants to provide responses that were not listed.

3. **Sampling Method**: Initially, I used convenience sampling due to time constraints, but I realized this could introduce significant sampling bias. To improve the survey quality, I made an effort to use stratified sampling by dividing the population into key subgroups and sampling proportionally. This change ensures better representation across different segments of the target population.

4. **Ethical Considerations**: I added a detailed consent form at the beginning of the survey that explains the purpose of the survey, how the data will be used, and reassures participants about the confidentiality of their responses. This adheres to ethical guidelines and ensures participants understand their rights and privacy.



3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```

    ```

The purpose of my survey is to gather opinions, attitudes, and self-reported experiences from participants regarding a particular topic. This type of subjective information is best collected through direct questioning, as observational studies are more suited for collecting objective, measurable behaviors without interacting with the participants.

An observational study could not fulfill the purpose of my survey because it would not allow me to understand participants' thoughts, motivations, or attitudes, which are inherently subjective and cannot be directly observed. Observational studies are valuable when examining behaviors in a natural setting, but they do not capture the reasoning or opinions behind those behaviors. Therefore, a survey was necessary to meet the goals of my research.




    

## Why am I doing this assignment?

This assignment supports learning outcomes 1, 2, 3, and 4:
	1.	Develop ability to implement simple probability samples.
	2.	Understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
	3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
	4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.

## Rubric
